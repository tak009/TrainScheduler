# Train Scheduler
- A train scheduler is an application that incorporates Firebase to host arrival and departure data. The app will retrieve and manipulate this information with Moment.js. This website will provide up-to-date information about various trains, namely their arrival times and how many minutes remain until they arrive at their station.
- The app is available on GitHub Pages, [**https://taknalut.github.io/TrainScheduler**](https://taknalut.github.io/TrainScheduler)
